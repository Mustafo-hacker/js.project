# What is JavaScript?
### > JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior
### > The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web pageâ€™s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
### > Brenden Eich creates the very first version of js in just 10 days. It was called Mocha, but already had many fundamental features of modern JavaScript!
### > Mocha changes to LiveScript and then to JavaScript, in order to attract Java developers.
### > in 2009 ECMAScript 5 is released with lots of great new features;
### > in 2015 ECMAScript get a biggest update ever to the language over!

# Using of JavaScript
### > The use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots. JavaScript engines are now embedded in a variety of other software systems, both for server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.
### > Initial attempts at promoting server-side JavaScript usage were Netscape Enterprise Server and Microsoft's Internet Information Services,but they were small niches.Server-side usage eventually started to grow in the late 2000s, with the creation of Node.js and other approaches.
### > Electron, Cordova, React Native, and other application frameworks have been used to create many applications with behavior implemented in JavaScript. Other non-browser applications include Adobe Acrobat support for scripting PDF documents and GNOME Shell extensions written in JavaScript.
### > JavaScript has been used in some embedded systems, usually by leveraging Node.js.

# What is Node.JS ?
### > Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
### > Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
# Who create Node.JS ?
### > Node.js was initially written by Ryan Dahl in 2009, about 13 years after the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web. The initial release supported only Linux and Mac OS X. Its development and maintenance was led by Dahl and later sponsored by Joyent.
